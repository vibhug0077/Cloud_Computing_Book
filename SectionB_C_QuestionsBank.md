    * Flexible scaling based on demand.
    * Can adjust resources based on actual usage.
  * **Example**: Paying for cloud services like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.

---

## **Q2. Explain How CAPEX and OPEX Considerations Influence the Choice Between Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud Models. (6 Marks)**

### **Public Cloud (OPEX)**:

* **CAPEX Consideration**: No significant upfront investment required. Instead, costs are pay-as-you-go.
* **OPEX Consideration**: The business only pays for the resources it uses, making it easier to manage operational costs.
* **Influence**: Companies that prefer to avoid large upfront expenditures and want to scale quickly and flexibly will prefer public cloud. It‚Äôs ideal for businesses that need cost-effective, short-term infrastructure solutions with low maintenance.

### **Private Cloud (CAPEX)**:

* **CAPEX Consideration**: High upfront capital investment in infrastructure, servers, networking equipment, and data centers.
* **OPEX Consideration**: Operational costs like maintenance, electricity, and IT staff salaries are ongoing, but the initial expenditure can be amortized.
* **Influence**: Businesses with strict regulatory or security requirements may lean toward private cloud, but the high upfront cost and limited scalability might deter small to medium enterprises that prefer lower OPEX and flexible scaling.

### **Hybrid Cloud (CAPEX and OPEX)**:

* **CAPEX Consideration**: Businesses still need some capital investment for their private cloud or on-premises infrastructure.
* **OPEX Consideration**: Ongoing operational costs are paid for the public cloud part.
* **Influence**: Hybrid clouds allow organizations to maintain control over critical workloads while taking advantage of OPEX benefits from public clouds. This model suits businesses that want a balance between cost control, performance, and regulatory compliance.
